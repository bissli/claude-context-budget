# Example handoff: three finished cycles

The file below is `hq` output: three finished cycles on a synthetic
thread whose repo sits at `~/code/poller`. The cursor (Task through
Open questions) is the agent's; the header line and everything from the
first `<!-- hq:` marker down is the script's. The golden test in
`tests/test_hq_messages.py` replays the three cycles and compares the
rendered file to this one line for line.

# Handoff: auth-token-refresh

Written: 2026-08-26 | Cycle: 3 | master @ fcbab89 | dirty: scripts/auth.py

## Task
Refresh expired OAuth tokens in the poller instead of failing the run.

## Now
Wire refresh_token() into poll() at scripts/auth.py:88, in the 401 branch.

## Plan
- [x] Steps 1-3: token store, refresh endpoint, unit tests (cycles 1-2)
- [ ] Wire refresh into the poll() 401 branch
- [ ] Integration test against the staging IdP

## State
- Verified: refresh_token() round-trips against staging (cycle 2).
- Unverified: retry backoff - written, never exercised.

## Environment
- test: python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
- staging IdP secret: env IDP_CLIENT_SECRET, set in ~/.env.staging

## Open questions
- Cap retry backoff at 60s, or give up after five tries? Blocks the
  integration test.

## Standing
### Constraints
[c01] (c1) **Never log token values** Not even at debug; the user said so.
### Decisions
[d01] (c1) **Refresh in-process, no sidecar**
### Dead ends
[x01] (c1) **httpx event hooks for auto-refresh**
[x02] (c1) **A pid in the lock.**
