"""Stop hook that catches a HANDOFF.md edited outside the ledger.

Every finished cycle records the digest of the HANDOFF.md it finished
on. An agent that writes the file directly - the habit the skill exists
to replace - leaves that digest behind, and nothing says so until the
next ``hq.py open`` prints LEDGER BEHIND, often a session later.

This hook compares the file against the last recorded digest at the end
of every turn and names the cycle the folder is now behind.

Notes
-----
- A folder holding .hq.lock is inside an open cycle. The edit is the
  work in progress and ``finish`` will record it, so it is skipped.
- One message per digest per session. A second hand edit changes the
  digest and reports again; the same edit never repeats.
- Exit is always 0. Exit 2 would block the stop, which no advisory
  message may do.
- The state file is ``<session>.handoff.json``, shared with the gate
  hook. The context-budget hook's ``<session>.json`` is never touched.

    - A subagent shares neither the folder nor the user's attention, so
      its Stop is dropped whole.
    - stop_hook_active means this Stop was itself raised by a hook. The
      state would suppress a repeat anyway; the guard keeps the hook out
      of the loop in the first place.
