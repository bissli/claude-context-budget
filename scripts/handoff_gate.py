"""PreToolUse hook that names the handoff files a write should have read.

A handoff ledger marks some artifacts read_before=always or edit. Those
are the files whose content the next session has to hold before it
changes anything - the spec it is building to, the draft it is about to
edit. Nothing enforces that today: the agent opens the handoff, reads
the cursor, and edits the repo without ever opening the spec.

This hook watches each write after an ``hq open`` and, when a gated
path the write needs has not been read this session, hands the model
one line naming the path and the lines to read.

Notes
-----
- The hook runs on every Bash, Edit, Write, and NotebookEdit call on the
  machine, so the common path globs the ancestors of the write target
  and of cwd for a ledger and stops. Only a write that reaches a project
  holding a handoff ledger costs more.
- Reach is decided by the write target, never by cwd alone: the root is
  the nearest ancestor of the target holding ``.handoff/*/ledger.tsv``,
  and a target under no such root is in reach only under the armed
  folder's pinned work dir.
- An ``always`` row is named at the first write in reach; an ``edit``
  row at a write to its own path. Each path is named once per session:
  a gate that repeats becomes noise, and the model has the message in
  context from the first time.
- It fails open in every direction: bad payload, missing transcript,
  unreadable ledger, or any unexpected exception exits 0 in silence. A
  broken gate must never stop a tool call.
- Evidence of a read is the Read tool, the path as an argument of a
  shell segment whose command word is a read verb, or an ``hq read``
  receipt. A path named to ``ls``, ``wc``, or ``grep`` was listed or
  searched, not read, and a path piped into ``head`` was never its
  argument.
- A write into the armed folder is the handoff's own bookkeeping and
  names no ``always`` row; an ``edit`` row is still named when the
  target is its own path. A ``cd`` inside the command and a shell
  variable holding the path are not seen, so such a write still
  reports.
